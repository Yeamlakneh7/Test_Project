This project is a music management application built with React and Redux, featuring Redux-Saga for efficient handling of asynchronous operations. Users can manage their song collection by adding, updating, and deleting songs, with the state managed seamlessly through Redux. The application also utilizes Emotion for styling components, ensuring a visually appealing and responsive user interface. Key functionalities include fetching song details, editing existing songs, and adding new ones, all supported by a robust API interaction layer built with Axios.
